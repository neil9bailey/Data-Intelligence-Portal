# Data Intelligence Portal

Dedicated product concept for a general public-sector customer, framework, procurement-source and requirement intelligence platform.

This repo is a planning and UI-mockup baseline for a standalone intelligence product. The proposed solution focuses on gathering, normalising, tracking and reporting useful customer and opportunity intelligence for bid, sales, strategy, service design, delivery and account teams.

## What It Is

Data Intelligence Portal is a configurable information-gathering workspace for:

- public-sector customers and account profiles
- procurement frameworks and opportunity notices
- official/public procurement data sources
- buyer portal platforms and customer portal instances
- ITT documents, quality questions, weightings and clarification records
- requirement themes and customer demand signals
- source-change monitoring and connector health
- executive summaries and exportable intelligence reports

## What It Is Not

- It is not a bid/no-bid decision engine.
- It is not a replacement for commercial, legal, procurement or compliance review.
- It does not automate customer contact, portal submissions or expressions of interest without explicit future governance.
- It does not store portal passwords or secrets in the MVP.

## Proposed MVP Stack

- Python 3.12
- FastAPI
- SQLModel / SQLAlchemy
- SQLite for local MVP persistence
- Jinja2 server-rendered HTML
- HTMX for dynamic interactions
- YAML-backed source and extraction configuration
- pytest
- Docker Desktop

## Official Source Baseline

The plan references official/public procurement routes checked on 2026-05-17:

- GOV.UK Contracts Finder
- GOV.UK public-sector procurement guidance
- Find a Tender service and developer documentation
- Contracts Finder API documentation
- Public Contracts Scotland API
- TED eForms developer material

## Recommended Next Step

Approve the product scope and UI direction, then build the MVP app in this repo using the architecture and epics described in `docs/`.
